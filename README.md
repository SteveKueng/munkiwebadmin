## Introduction

This is version 2 of MunkiWebAdmin, a web-based administration tool for Munki.

All reporting (formerly part of MunkiWebAdmin) has been removed from MunkiWebAdmin2 â€” consider using Sal or MunkiReport-PHP for reporting. Both are excellent.

MunkiWebAdmin2 focuses on web-based editing of manifests and pkginfo files.

This is in-developement code. Please do not point it at a production Munki repo.

## Getting started

On OS X (10.7+):

*   Download and expand this zip:    
    https://github.com/munki/contrib/raw/master/mwa2_demo.zip

*   Via the command-line, run the script within the expanded zip:
    `https://github.com/SteveKueng/munki_dev/blob/master/mwa2_demo.zip`

*   Follow the script prompts. Of note, at one place you'll be advised to edit a settings file. Specifically, you'll edit `mwa2/munkiwebadmin/settings.py`. Near the end of this file is this:

```python
# MUNKI_REPO_DIR holds the local filesystem path to the Munki repo
MUNKI_REPO_DIR = '/Users/Shared/munki_repo'
```

*   Edit `MUNKI_REPO_DIR` to point to a Munki repo to use with MWA2. Please don't point it at your production repo unless you like living very dangerously. This repo should be writable by the user running MWA2.

*   After editing `settings.py`, run `run_mwa2.sh` again to continue the setup process.

*   Once all the setup tasks are complete, a development server will be launched, and MWA2 should be available at http://localhost:8080

#### run_mwa2.sh script details

*   Clones `https://github.com/munki/mwa2.git` from GitHub into the script directory (if needed)
*   Copies `settings_template.py` to `settings.py` and asks you to edit it. (if needed)
*   Creates the needed sqlite3 database. (if needed)
*   Prompts you to create the initial superuser. (if needed)
*   Uses the included CherryPy dev server to serve MWA2.

    `self.validate(display_num_errors=True)` to `self.check(display_num_errors=True)`
