Munki-Catalog-Admin
--------------

This is an altered version of MunkiWebAdmin (v1) fromm Greg Neagle.
See https://github.com/munki/munkiwebadmin

This version was forked from Steve Kueng's version, in order
to add functionality for editing Packages, specifically 
changing the catalog of packages, and deleting packages.

Documentation of Steve's version is here:
https://github.com/SteveKueng/munkiwebadmin/wiki

I'll add documentation for this version in due course.

To Do
----

It is still a work in progress. Package deletion is not yet functional.

Also:
Remove Inventory / Reporting / License tools
